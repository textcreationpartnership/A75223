            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ACCOUNT Of the Behaviour of Sir <hi>John Fenwick,</hi> at his Execution on <hi>Tower-Hill;</hi> with the Copy of the Paper delivered by him to the Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>SIR <hi>John Fenwick,</hi> on the Day of his Execution, aroſe at Four a Clock in the Morning, and was privat until Seven: At Ten he came out of <hi>Newgate</hi> into a Mourning Coach, was received by the Sheriffs and Guards, and conducted to <hi>Tower-Hill;</hi> in his paſſage he fix'd his Eyes on a Prayer Book, and ſpoke not a word to any perſon. So numerous were the Spectators, that it was paſt Eleven half an Hour before he came upon the Scaffold; where it was obſerved at firſt, that he ſeemed to be ſomewat ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, and for a few Moments ſtood Speechleſs, but ſoon after appeared with great compoſure of Mind; and after ſaluting thoſe on the Scaffold, deſired Dr. <hi>White</hi> to pray with him: Which being over, he thank'd the Sheriffs for their Civilities, and delivered them a Paper, deſiring them to do him that Juſtice as to give it the King. He then prayed again, and having forgiven the Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, prepared himſelf for the Block, and the Sign being given, the Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, at one blow, ſever'd his Head from his Body; which was brought in a Hearſe to one Mr. <hi>Metcalfs,</hi> an Upholſter, at the <hi>Helmet</hi> in <hi>Fleet-ſtreet,</hi> and thence, that Night, privatly Interred in the Church of St. <hi>Martins</hi> in the Field. The Sheriffs, according to his deſire, delivered the Paper to the King; which is as follows.</p>
            <p>SPeaking nor Writing was never my Talent; I ſhall therefore give a very ſhort, but faithful Account. Firſt, Of my Religion; and next, What I ſuffer moſt innocently for, to avoid the Calumnies I may reaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect my Enemies will caſt upon me when Dead, ſince they have moſt falſly and maliciouſly aſperſed me, whilſt under my Misfortunes.</p>
            <p>As for my Religion; I was brought up in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it is Eſtabliſhed by Law, and have ever profeſſed it; tho, I confeſs, I have been an unworthy Member of it, in not living up to the ſtrict and excellent Rules thereof, for which I take ſhame to myſelf, and humbly ask forgiveneſs of God. I come now to Die in that Communion, truſting, as an humble and hearty Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, to be received by the Mercy of God, through the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt my Saviour.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:150536:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>My Religion taught me my Loyalty, which I bleſs God, is untainted; and I have ever endeavoured, in the Station wherein I have been placed, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of my power, to ſupport the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> in the true and lineal courſe of Deſcent, without interruption.</p>
            <p>As for what I am now to Die, I call God to witneſs, I went not to that Meeting in <hi>Leaden-Hall-Street</hi> with any ſuch intention, as to Invite King <hi>James</hi> by Force to Invade this Nation; nor was I my ſelf provided with ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Horſe or Arms, or engaged for any number of Men, or gave particular conſent for any ſuch Invaſion, as is moſt falſly Sworn againſt me.</p>
            <p>I do alſo declare, in the preſence of GOD, that I knew nothing of King <hi>James</hi> his coming to <hi>Calais,</hi> nor of any Invaſion intended from thence, till it was publickly known; and the only Notion I had that ſomething might be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, was from the <hi>Thoulon</hi> Fleet coming to <hi>Breſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I alſo call GOD to witneſs, that I received the knowledge, of what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in thoſe Papers that I gave to a Great Man that came to me in the <hi>Tower,</hi> both from Letters and Meſſages that came from <hi>France;</hi> and he told me, when I read them to him, that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had been acquained with moſt of thoſe things before:</p>
            <p>I might have expected Mercy from that Prince, becauſe I was Inſtrumental in ſaving his Life; for when, about <hi>April</hi> 95, an Attempt formed againſt him, came to my knowledge, I did partly by Diſſwaſions, and partly by Delays, prevent that Deſign; which, I ſuppoſe, was the reaſon that the laſt Villain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Project was concealed from me.</p>
            <p>If there be any Perſons whom I have Injured in Word or Deed, I heartily pray their Pardon, and beg of GOD to Pardon thoſe who have injured me; particularly, thoſe who with great Zeal hath ſought my Life, and brought the guilt of my Innocent Blood upon this Nation, no Treaſon being proved upon me.</p>
            <p>I return my moſt hearty Thanks to thoſe Noble and worthy Perſons who gave their Aſſiſtance, by oppoſing this Bill of Attainder; without which, it had been Impoſſible I could have fallen under the Sentence of Death. God bleſs them and their Poſterity; tho', I am fully ſatisfied, they pleaded their own Cauſe while they defended mine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now, O God, I do with all humble Devotion commend my Soul into thy Hands, the great Maker and Preſerver of Men, and Lover of Souls; beſeeching thee, that it may be always dear and precious in thy ſight, through the Merits of my Saviour Jeſus Christ.</hi> Amen.</p>
